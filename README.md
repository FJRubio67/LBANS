This repository contains two data examples of link-based additive net survival models based on the paper "A unifying framework for flexible excess hazard modelling with applications in cancer epidemiology". The models are fitted using the R package `GJRM`.

1. The first example analyses the Simulacrum dataset (https://simulacrum.healthdatainsight.org.uk/) and focuses on differences in lung cancer survival according to different deprivation categories.

The R code and outputs for this example are also available in RPubs at: 

2. The second example analyses the `LeukSurv` dataset from the R package `spBayesSurv` and provides additional insight on how to model spatial components. Note, however, that we do not have access to life tables from those times based on the Townsend score so for the purpose of the example we used generic values of the population hazards based on more recent life tables.

The R code and outputs for this example are also available in RPubs at:
